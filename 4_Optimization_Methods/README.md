# Homework 4: Optimization Methods

## Description

In this homework you will practice how to implement different optimization methods using Tensorflow.

o To implement and understand each optimization methods.

## Instruction

You need to fill the block of code for each method:

o Naïve Update
o Momentum Update
o Nestrove Update
o AdaGrad Update
o RMSProb Update
o Adam Update

Record losses every 100 iterations for each update method.
