# Homework 3: Neural Network Classifier

## Description

In this homework you will practice how to write Neural Network classifier in Python with NumPy package. You need to understand how Neural Network classifier work, including back propagation and gradient decent in order to implement this homework successfully. The goals of this homework are:
- To implement and understand Neural Network classifier.

## Instruction

In this homework, you need to fill the block of code in 2 python files, runTwoLayersNN.py and twoLayersNN.py.

o runTwoLayersNN.py: This is the main file that you will execute. It reads and processes CIFAR10 dataset, initializes the classifiers, trains, and also tunes up hyper parameters.

o twoLayersNN.py: Two layers Neural Network class that contains 5 functions, initialize, train, predict, calculate loss, and calculate accuracy.
