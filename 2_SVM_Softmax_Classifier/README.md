# Homework 2 : Implement SVM and Softmax classifier

### Description

In this homework you will practice how to create SVM and Softmax classifiers in Python with NumPy package. You need to understand how SVM and Sofmax classifier works, including back propagation and gradient decent is performed in order to complete this homework
successfully. The goals of this homework are:
- To understand the steps to train/test the classifier for image classification.
- To use the validation dataset for tune up hyper parameters.
- To implement and understand SVM classifier.
- To implement and understand Softmax classifier.

### Software Installation

Before you start, install matplotlib package to plot images and weights, and install Keras
to load CIFAR10 dataset by using this command.

- Windows10:

o Download “scipy‑0.19.1‑cp35‑cp35m‑win_amd64.whl” from
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy

o Go to download location of file using cmd then type

o “pip3 install scipy‑0.19.1‑cp35‑cp35m‑win_amd64.whl”

o “pip3 install matplotlib==2.0.0”

o “pip3 install --upgrade keras”

- Linux/Mac:

o Open terminal and run

o “sudo pip3 install matplotlib==2.0.0”

o “sudo pip3 install --upgrade keras”
